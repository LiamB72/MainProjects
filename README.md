Rep Used to store all the main projects, for which I gave a lot of my time (too much).


And yes, it does take a lot of time to do those things, like a lot, just to do the most significant things that noone will ever do or just even think about =, but because you did, you can not stop until you find the fine solution (pun not intended) to do it. And also a lot of sleep deprevation (just at my 6th night of no sleep in a row (ofc I sleep up until 4pm when I'm done working all night) ). 

But personnally I love what I do. So I'm fine stay up all night for that ,w,
